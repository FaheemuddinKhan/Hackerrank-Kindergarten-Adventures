1) Find all the values in the 'diagonals': the number of children that finish the painting exactly when the teacher passes to collect it.

2) Find the number of paintings finished for the case of the teacher starting at child 0. This can be done in the for loop of step 1.

3) To move one child to the right (child 1), take the value for child 0, subtract the diagonal for child 0 and add 1 since child 0 will have for sure finished the painting. Then repeat this step until the last child.
